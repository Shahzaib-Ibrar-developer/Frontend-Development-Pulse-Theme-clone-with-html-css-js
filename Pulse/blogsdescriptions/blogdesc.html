                <p>Carl Smith is the founding member of nGen Works, a digital creative firm that has been
                    building some
                    of
                    the world’s finest hand-crafted websites since 2003. Carl has made a name for himself in the
                    web
                    world
                    by always defending the needs and wants of the end-user. He has been privileged to lead
                    teams that
                    have
                    been awarded the New York Art Directors Award For Interactive Development, The Hospitality
                    Industry’s
                    Best of Show Award, two National C.A.S.E. awards for Educational Web Development. He has
                    also been
                    featured in Kelly Goto’s best selling book Web Redesign: Workflow That Works. Carl spends
                    most of
                    his
                    free time complaining about sites that say “click here,” chasing his daughters, and praying
                    they
                    never
                    make Spiderman 4.</p>
                <h6>What were the reasons that lead you to start using Pulse?</h6>
                <p>I started using Pulse to kill that sick feeling in my stomach when I didn’t know if we would make
                    payroll. Being in an industry full of 50/50 payment projects, or getting paid in thirds, it can be
                    super
                    confusing when money will come in. Receivables don’t tell half the story, or even a third sometimes.
                    So
                    I went looking for a solution and low and behold I found Pulse. </p>
                <h6>Describe how you use Pulse and how it fits within your accounting workflow. </h6>
                <p>Basically I use Pulse separately from our accounting system. As the business owner, it’s really my
                    toy
                    and my baby. I manually update when it looks like cash will come in and variations in payables.
                    Sometimes I look at how cashflow from a project will impact us and decide if we really want a
                    project,
                    or if a client starts acting up what the impact will be if we walk away. Thanks to Pulse I know
                    right
                    now we’re solid through May of 2010 so we can take 2 weeks off as a company at the end of the year.
                    Without Pulse I might not be as confident in that decision. It also helps when looking at employee
                    bonuses and planning for conferences. Ultimately it helps me see potential outcomes as I play with
                    “what
                    if” scenarios</p>
                <h6>What do you like most about Pulse?</h6>
                <p>The flexibility. It’s so easy to add or remove a project, or shift a receivable or expense. It’s also
                    easy on the eyes which is a plus for us. It’s funny, but I’ve shown it to colleagues and clients
                    because
                    I think it helps position us as a smart business. Hopefully I’ve turned a lot of people onto Pulse.
                </p>
                <h6>How has Pulse helped your business?</h6>
                <p>Pulse makes nGen Works smarter. We make better
                    decisions because we can see further. You could
                    say it’s lowered our stress level by removing
                    the fear of not knowing.</p>
                <h6>Is there anything else you’d like to add?</h6>
                <p>I speak quite a bit about establishing trust with users, and I use Pulse as an example. I asked you
                    to
                    provide the ability to zero out over a year ago and you ended up adding that feature in. You had me
                    as a
                    customer at that point because you listened.</p>
