                        <h1>How RealtyNinja Uses Pulse to Avoid Stress About Cash Flow</h1>
                        <h2>Tell us about yourself and your business.</h2>
                        <p>My name is Casimir Loeber and I am co-founder of RealtyNinja. We are a creative agency that
                            specializes in custom web design and development, print and graphic design. We are a tight
                            team that prides itself in our agility and ability to come up with a solution to almost any
                            visual or technical problem. We are located in Vancouver, B.C. Canada and serve clients
                            around the globe.</p>
                    </div>

                <p>As most entrepreneurs will know, there are never enough hours in the day to do the work that pays the
                    bills, let alone the behind-the-scenes work most of us hate to do. Both my business partner and I
                    knew from the beginning that we were not the accountant types or even good bookkeepers. What we did
                    know how to do was preserve the paper trail and plug numbers into websites. This led us to Pulse,
                    which allowed us to visualize our cash flow before our brains turned to snow with receipts,
                    spreadsheets, and accordion folders.</p>
                <h6>What were the reasons that led you to start using Pulse?</h6>
                <p>If we have a large prospect on the horizon we take 2 seconds to put it in Pulse to see how it affects
                    us; simple as that.</p>
                <h6>Describe how you use Pulse and how it fits within your accounting workflow.</h6>
                <p>Before we had a bookkeeper, we would simply export our invoice totals from our invoicing system
                    (Freshbooks!) and enter these values as income in Pulse. We were pretty good with our expense paper
                    trails and would just go through our credit card and cheque book for these values. As things started
                    to ramp up and consume more time, we hired a bookkeeper and gave her the keys to our Pulse account.
                    She was able to pick it up in no time and now all we do is log in every couple of days to see where
                    we are, where we are headed, and where we came from. If we have a large prospect on the horizon, we
                    take 2 seconds to put it in Pulse to see how it affects us; simple as that.</p>
                <h6>What do you like most about Pulse?</h6>
                <p>What I like most about Pulse is that it turns something that is very number heavy and hard to
                    visualize into something that is easy to look at. I can take a quick look at my Pulse account and
                    see exactly where we miscalculated on a quote and how long it took us to recover from that. The
                    reporting functionality is definitely the strong point with Pulse and has the potential to be
                    expanded in many great directions.</p>
                <h6>How has Pulse helped your business?</h6>
                <p>Pulse has taken the fear and stress out of cash flow projection and management. It has seriously made
                    it so that I can sleep better knowing that I am not going to randomly run out of cash tomorrow. It
                    is easy to learn and easy to teach, so integrating it into our workflow was not an issue at all.</p>
                <h6>Is there anything else you’d like to add?</h6>
                <p>I want to say 2 last things. The first being that seeing the blue line climb upwards and the green
                    bars tower over the red makes me want to dance. Secondly, I can’t wait to see what the people at
                    Pulse will cook up next.</p>
