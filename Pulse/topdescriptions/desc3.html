                        <h1>5 Steps to Optimizing A Services Business from Brogan Renshaw, Founder of FireWire Digital
                        </h1>
                        <img src="../assets/blog_assets/img-5.png" alt="loading...">
                        <p>Professional services, especially digital advertising services, are widely popular due to the
                            low overhead and how quickly they can go to market. But this can be a double-edged sword for
                            an agency owner who is trying to offer as many services as possible. It’s far too easy to
                            overpromise and underdeliver if you lack direction.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>In mid-2017, SEO specialist Brogan Renshaw saw this pitfall first-hand at the general marketing firm
                    he was working at.

                    At the time, he was unable to deal directly with clients and his superiors were overpromising SEO
                    results, in part because they didn’t understand the discipline. When he left the company, Brogan
                    realized that he could land clients on his own. So he investigated the market and discovered that
                    there were no single-service agencies focused on SEO in his region of Australia. college, graduate
                    school, and professional exams.F</p>
                <p>When he noticed the gap in the market, he decided to start his own agency, FireWire Digital. While he
                    specialized in SEO and Google ads, Brogan also took on some social media ad projects for initial
                    revenue. But within 12 months, he was able to drop social ad services and focus solely on SEO.

                    We spoke with Brogan to learn more about how he manages the several expenses that are associated
                    with SEO and how he’s grown his business.

                </p>
                <p>But the biggest shift for LA Tutors came with the pandemic. The lockdowns forced Arash to pivot his
                    business model and focus on online tutoring services.
                    We had a chance to sit down and speak with Arash on the Cash Flow Show to learn more about how he
                    managed to quickly scale and adapt his business during the pandemic.</p>

                <h2>1. Narrow down your services</h2>
                <p>Another benefit of niching his services list is reducing overhead costs. SEO tools are expensive, and
                    there are thousands of variations. One of the biggest barriers to entry is the cost of premium
                    software.

                    For example, the popular keyword and market research tool SEMRush can cost more than $500 a month.
                    And while there are many free options, they don’t cover everything an SEO specialist needs to do
                    their job.

                    “I was lucky that when I started, I had some initial income and could purchase some of the basic
                    tools,” says Brogan. “At the time, I was probably only using about 20% of the tools we have now. The
                    costs of tools are massive.”

                    The key, Brogan tells us, is that business owners need to be selective and strategic when choosing
                    their first tools. The focus should be on what combination of software will provide the best results
                    for the client.</p>
                <h2>2. Choose your tools wisely</h2>
                <p>For Arash, that meant it was time to focus on a new strategy.
                    “We had used Zoom and other services for the past few years, so we could quickly change gears and
                    work remotely,” says Arash. “And since schools were closed, we shifted our focus to general
                    academics instead of test prep.”</p>
                <p>Another critical aspect is setting prices. Services agencies can choose to charge by the hour,
                    project, or a percentage of the revenue generated.

                    While Brogan charges on a project and retainer basis, he also recently established an affiliate
                    marketing component to his business. His team always had the skills necessary to implement it but
                    lacked the time and resources. With the main business thriving, Brogan decided it was time to
                    finally bring in this second stream of income.

                    “It's almost like a separate business within the company. You have your client-side, and then you
                    have the affiliate-side,” says Brogan. “What we like to do is buy an existing site that's a little
                    bit established and then build it up.”

                    Brogan’s affiliate marketing program is based on the following steps:

                    Buy a site

                    Optimize it

                    Add quality content

                    Sell the website again.

                    These websites generally sell at 30-40 times their monthly revenue, which offers a significant
                    second income stream. For example, if Brogan has a website that brings in $100 per month, he could
                    sell it for $3,000. Ideally, he works on generating $1,000 in revenue for his affiliate sites, so he
                    can sell them for closer to $30,000.

                    Good candidates include websites that are already fairly established. A website should have some
                    existing content and traffic with the potential to grow. At this stage, it’s important to conduct an
                    SEO audit to map out both potential problems and opportunities. For every potential investment,
                    Brogan has to ask questions like</p>
                <p>Between his regular clients and affiliate marketing program, Brogan has been able to steadily grow
                    his business. Client retainers provide access to immediate and predictable capital. The affiliate
                    websites act as long-term investments, with their current affiliate revenue offsetting a portion of
                    the expenses. Together, the two income streams provide more flexibility and prevent revenue from
                    drying out during slow periods.</p>
                <p>How was Arash able to quickly change course? He attributes it to his budget for unexpected events.
                    “We always had the vision that we need to have some budget on the side for potential changes,” notes
                    Arash. “You always have something on the side in case you need to update your services or train
                    tutors with new technology. Luckily, we had that.”
                    Going into the business, Arash knew that many important topics in the test prep industry today may
                    not be as relevant tomorrow. For example, more and more universities are making the SATs optional.
                    As a result, Arash and his team have to be sensitive to the market and what focus areas will help
                    students succeed. This means being willing to cut services and design new ones to meet the industry
                    shifts.</p>
                <h2>5. Grow your business through cash flow tracking</h2>
                <p>Whether you’ve just started your business or you’ve been in the game a while, understanding your cash
                    flow at a glance is critical for success. Not only can you make better decisions, but it’s easier to
                    spot expense creep and unused software subscriptions.

                    “I think that as a business owner, you have to track cash flow. I mean, otherwise, you're just
                    burying your head in the sand, and you're asking for problems,” says Brogan. “Around 80% of
                    businesses fail in their first couple of years, and I'd say that's often down to the management of
                    the money.”

                    Cash flow projections and easy-to-understand visual reports are vital to making strategic decisions
                    faster and keeping your business healthy.</p>
                <h2>The payoff of investing in tech</h2>
                <p>LA Tutors uses 2 main programs to run the business efficiently and keep track of a growing database
                    of clients and instructors:

                    Salesforce to support staff scheduling

                    Zapier for automating tasks

                    Salesforce is a highly customizable reporting and scheduling platform. The LA Tutors team can review
                    which instructor is meeting with which client, how many hours the client has used, and schedule
                    future lessons.

                    The second crucial software, Zapier, is an automation tool that links other platforms into
                    Salesforce. So, for example, if an instructor schedules a lesson using Zoom, it may be imported into
                    Salesforce automatically.

                    To ensure that his team is happy with the software and that the investments work as intended, Arash
                    keeps employee feedback loops open. He and the team reevaluate solutions on the market when a
                    software or technology workflow gets negative feedback from several instructors.

                    “I think that feedback and open communication with staff and employees are super crucial for any
                    business,” says Arash.</p>
