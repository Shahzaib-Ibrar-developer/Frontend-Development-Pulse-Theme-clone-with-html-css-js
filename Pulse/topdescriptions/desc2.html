                        <h1>Monetizing a Network: How Jodi Brandstetter Started Her Second Business</h1>
                        <img src="../assets/blog_assets/img-2.jpg" alt="loading...">
                        <p>Jodi Brandstetter is a consultant and serial entrepreneur with over two decades of recruiting
                            experience. In 2018, she founded a consulting firm with an emphasis on helping small and
                            mid-sized businesses in STEM hire better recruiters and talent. But after writing and
                            marketing her first book on recruiting talent, Jodi realized that business leaders across
                            industries needed a streamlined approach to publishing and promoting business books.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Drafting, writing, and editing a book are hard enough. But C-Suite executives and entrepreneurs then
                    have to source book covers, format their book, decide on distribution channels, and figure out their
                    marketing plan. It is too easy to get lost in the process and forget about writing and publishing a
                    book altogether.</p>
                <p>In addition to adding new tutoring focuses. Arash also expanded the organization outside of Los
                    Angeles to San Francisco and New York.</p>
                <p>That’s why Jodi founded Influence Network Media in 2021. It’s a professional community that provides
                    support and services for writing, publishing, and marketing books for
                    business-leaders-turned-authors. Influence Network Media is more than a passion project—it’s a
                    business in its own right.</p>

                <h2>What is a network business? </h2>
                <p>A network business is more than a forum or group, although many successful network platforms start
                    off this way. Influence Network Media offers a combination of a free group, paid courses, and
                    “do-it-for-you” concierge services. The free group provides access to a community of fellow business
                    writers and supporters, while book production services are bundled into packages.

                    Setting up a second business with so many social elements can be time-consuming. For that reason,
                    Jodi decided to bring on a partner. This would allow her to better balance her consulting business
                    with the network and bring another set of skills into the business.</p>
                <p>“I made that decision to find a partner who actually complements me,” says Jodi. “So I'm more of the
                    Chief Operating Officer, and she is more the business development side. So we work well together in
                    that perspective.”</p>
                <h2>From free to monetized services</h2>
                <p>Inside the free Influence Network Media group, potential clients can ask questions, interact with
                    Jodi and her team, and meet with other business leaders. This both qualifies leads and gives the
                    group and the network more authority.

                    These clients can choose to then buy a guided course to write, edit, publish, and market their book.
                    Courses start at $799 and help clients figure out the perfect headshot to becoming a bestseller on
                    Amazon.

                    Jodi outsources to independent contractors for work like design, book editing, ghostwriting, and
                    other tasks. She also coaches authors who want hands-on experience.</p>
                <p>“We always had the vision that we need to have some budget on the side for potential changes. You
                    always have something on the side in case you need to update your services or train tutors with new
                    technology. Luckily, we had that.”</p>
                <p>When I started my consulting business, I started with just a checking account and a business credit
                    card,” notes Jodi. “And then I added accounts for my first business over time so that I could bucket
                    my money. I now have one savings account that's just for taxes, and I have another one for a rainy
                    day.The Influence Network Media’s signature offering is a multi-author book service, which is
                    unique. In this service, an author can choose to take ownership over one chapter in a multi-author
                    book. This can be extremely useful for influencers who are not ready to write a whole book but still
                    want to expand their thought leadership.

                    If they want more assistance, potential clients can also choose to contact her team for a concierge
                    service based on their budget. Jodi and her team will then locate ghostwriters, cover designers, and
                    other professionals to get the book finished. The team can also help with market efforts, such as
                    arranging podcast interviews, press releases, and other events.</p>
                <h2>Strategic money management between businesses</h2>
                <p>If there’s one thing Jodi appreciates, it’s keeping expenses down. She uses several inexpensive or
                    free applications to keep meticulous business records. For example, she uses Wave app for invoicing,
                    which is a free application for small businesses.

                    To keep her business accounts organized, Jodi keeps a separate account for each business, each at
                    completely different financial institutions. This makes it easy to separate the accounts mentally
                    and prevents her from using her consulting account for her network business and vice versa.

                    “When I started my consulting business, I started with just a checking account and a business credit
                    card,” notes Jodi. “And then I added accounts for my first business overtime so that I could bucket
                    my money. I now have one savings account that's just for taxes, and I have another one for a rainy
                    day.”

                    Currently, she budgets about 5% of her income for emergencies but plans to expand it to 10%
                    post-pandemic.

                    Since Influence Network Media is so new, she only has a single checking account and credit card. But
                    as the business grows, Jodi plans to add more “bucket” accounts to separate items like taxes and
                    expenses.

                    The biggest tip Jodi has for entrepreneurs? Know your strengths and weaknesses and reserve your cash
                    for services or tools that complement those weaknesses.

                    For example, Jodi says that she’s not nearly as good at creating advertising and marketing materials
                    as she is at running operations. For that reason, Jodi prefers to spend on marketing and advertising
                    but handles other aspects of the company herself, such as accounting, networking, and other
                    high-level tasks.

                    This cash flow strategy helps her keep a low overhead and retain more income, without doing
                    everything herself. allocate 5% of their revenue to investing in technology and training.</p>
                <h2>Cash flow management should be easy</h2>
                <p>LA Tutors uses 2 main programs to run the business efficiently and keep track of a growing database
                    of clients and instructors:

                    Salesforce to support staff scheduling

                    Zapier for automating tasks

                    Salesforce is a highly customizable reporting and scheduling platform. The LA Tutors team can review
                    which instructor is meeting with which client, how many hours the client has used, and schedule
                    future lessons.

                    The second crucial software, Zapier, is an automation tool that links other platforms into
                    Salesforce. So, for example, if an instructor schedules a lesson using Zoom, it may be imported into
                    Salesforce automatically.

                    To ensure that his team is happy with the software and that the investments work as intended, Arash
                    keeps employee feedback loops open. He and the team reevaluate solutions on the market when a
                    software or technology workflow gets negative feedback from several instructors.

                    “I think that feedback and open communication with staff and employees are super crucial for any
                    business,” says Arash.</p>
                <h2>Cash flow management should be easy</h2>
                <p>The key to keeping any business healthy and sustainable in the long term is cash flow. Whether you
                    need to boost your prices, reduce your expenses, hire help, or build that second business, the best
                    way to know when the time is right is to look at your cash flow statements.

                    For at-a-glance visuals and in-depth numbers, a cash management tool can help keep you on track.
                    Pulse is a cash flow tracking tool for business owners, built by business owners. Take your business
                    to the next level and start tracking your cash flow for the next 30 days, completely free.
